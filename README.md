# Swarm_Intelligence

We have implemented the following swarm algorithms with visualisations. Each of these swarm behaviours can be used in a multi - agent setting to achieve different objectives.  
<ul>
  <li> Couzin's model (can also be thought of as a fish school model) [1] </li>
  <li> Physicomimetics (We have mimed particle behavior in solids as discussed in [2] </li>
  <li> Shepherding model (Sheep - Sheepdog interaction two different tyes of agents with different behaviours)[3]</li>
</ul>
